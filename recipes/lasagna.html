<h2>Description of the dish</h2>
    
    <p>This hearty, vegetable lasagna is the only lasagna my husband will eat. 
    We love it! Hope you all enjoy it as much as we do.</p>

    <p>It is a very simple recipe that anyone could try to remake.</p>

    <p>It's also much more healthier then the conventional lasagna made from 
        traditional ingridients.</p>

        <ul><strong>ingridients</strong>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced </li>
            <li>¾ cup chopped green bell pepper </li>
            <li>¾ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Your favourite spices</li>
        </ul>
